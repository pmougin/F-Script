/* 
A circular storage for NSString objects.

The capacity is fixed at instance initialization and can't change.

Each instance keeps an internal "cursor" pointing to a position of its storage.
This cursor can be moved to a desired position with various methods. The cursor moves 
in a circular way: if you move the cursor forward enough then you will reach your 
starting point again. 

The method -getStr returns the string at the position designed by the cursor.

A string is added with the -addStr: method. Strings are always added with a FIFO scheme.
The cursor concept applies only for getting string, not for adding. Also note that getting
a string does not remove it from the storage. Strings are removed from the store following
the FIFO scheme: when the store is full and a new string is added, then the "oldest" string in the
store is removed.
